# TODO

The key items in the lists below are App Distribution, User Authentication, and Trip Selection - this will enable a simpler 
and more flexible process for distributing and installing the app without bundling the content at compile time.

The most requested feature from our users to this point has been Annotations and Note-taking on device.

These lists are by no means complete, but we think this is a good summary of what is needed to take this product
to the next level.

## E-Briefing App
- App Distribution (App Store or Enterprise Distribution)
- User Authentication
- Trip Selection on-device (and multiple trips)
- Annotations/Notes (with sync back to server)
- Edit/Manage Content on Device (and sync back to server)
- Push Notifications for updates
- Multilingual Interface (and content?)
- Google Maps (or other maps) integration for Locations

## E-Briefing Service
- User Registrations
- Team/Group Accounts and Invite Collaborators
- In-browser Briefing Preview
- Multilingual Interface (and content?)
